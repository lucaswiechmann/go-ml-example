# Golang Machine Learning Basics

The idea of this project is to scratch the surface of machine
learning properties in golang. Each project package implements
some of them using golang packages. Some of them covered are:
statistical properties, classification, regression, clustering,
anomaly detection, neural networks, outlier analysis.

## Requiriments

* Golang 1.17

### TensorFlow issues

If you have trouble installing tensorflow package:

* Install v1.12 version
* Check this [issue](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/125) for link issues


### Build

To build projet, run:
```
make build
```

### Test it

To check machine learning methods, select one option running makefile commands:
```
make help
```
