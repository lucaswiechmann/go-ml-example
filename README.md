# Golang Machine Learning Basics

The idea of this project is to scratch the surface of machine
learning properties in golang. Each project package implements
some of them using golang packages. Some of them covered are:
statistical properties, classification, regression, clustering,
anomaly detection, neural networks, outlier analysis.
